        <h1>Interneting is Easy!</h1>
        <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML</p>
        
        <h2>Headings</h2>
        <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings from h1 to h6</p>

        <h2>List</h2>
        <p>This is how you make an unorderd list:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add a "ul" element (stands for unorderd list).</li>
            <li>Add each item on its own "li" element.</li>
            <li>They don't need to be in particular order.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is how the ordered list look like:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Using the "ol" element instead of "ul".</li>
            <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everyting.</li>
            <li>But the list items "li" are the same.</li>
            <li>Also note the number increment on their own.</li>
            <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an ordered list.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
        <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
        <p>Other time, you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>
        <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

        <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
        <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be easier now.</p>
        <p>Regards,</br>
           The Authors</p>
